# Personal and academic portfolio

Hello! My name is [Luiz Felipe Pimenta Berrettini](https://github.com/PimentaBrrt), I was born in March 31, 2006, and I am currently studying Data Science at **ESPM (Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing)** in Brazil.
This repository contains a website built with **[MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**, showcasing my academic and personal development projects.
The content will be updated every semester to reflect my progress and new work.

Check out the [Github Pages](https://pimentabrrt.github.io/portfolio) for this project.
